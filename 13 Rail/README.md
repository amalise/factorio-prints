# Rails

This book contains my LHD 8-carriage train system. It is a robust and complex system which I cannot explain via text. It is also a bit of a work in progress (and every combination of mods will make some aspects change), so there are some scattered blueprints at the bottom.

## Sub-Books

### LHD - 8 Carriage

A set of blueprints for rapidly deploying a 4 lane LHD rail network spaced for 8 carriage trains. Blueprints snap to the global grid, and include integrated Large Power Poles with Red and Green signal wires from Vanilla and Bob's Power.

### Outpost

A modular outpost sytem for LHD 8 carriage trains. Snaps to the same global grid as the previous book. Provider and Requester station blueprints use Loaders.

### Rail Block Radars

Grid snapping blueprints for solar/radar arrays which align with the previous rail network for large area coverage. Vanilla and Bob's Radars.

### Mass Terrain Clearing

Utility book for automating bot destruction of old base buildings.

### Clear Terrain (destruction planner)

Utility planner which marks all natural entities (trees, rocks) for destruction.

### Build Trains

Blueprints for a simple build train; helpful for learning.

### 50 Depot Block

LTN depot blueprint which holds and refuels 50 trains. Be careful to configure desired fuel. Recycling will also push any mis-handled inventory back into the train system.
