## Raynquist's Balancers (Fall 2020)

A collection of N to X belt balancers designed by Raynquist. Note, balancing can have an impact on UPS for large bases; the splitters are CPU costly (each piece moved requires CPU time), and if they create non-saturated belts (for example, if the output is more belts than the input) the game must do much more math to track all the outputs on the belts. If UPS is a concern, I recommend overbuilding upstream production (to keep belts saturated) and using loaders into and out of chests as balancers.

## Speedrun!

A set of incremental blueprints to construct the speedrun factory design from Nefrums on YouTube. These blueprints can easily accomplish the achievements Lazy Bastard, Getting On Track Like A Pro, and There Is No Spoon in a Vanilla game. You'll have to practice and watch Nefrums' guide to learn how.
