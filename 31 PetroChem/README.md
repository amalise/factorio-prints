## Upgrade Planners

Upgrade planners are designed to convert all items of a type to the target type. So the Plastic Pipe upgrade planner will convert all other pipes to Plastic. Note, there are not upgradable pipes, tanks, or pumps in Vanilla; Bob's mod suite includes upgrades in a couple places, so not all types of pipe may be available. Not all possible pipe flavor upgrades have upgrade planners here, but if you want to use a different type of pipe it is easy to create a new upgrade planner by copying an existing one. While Bob's mods includes 12 different compositions of pipe, there are only really 4 different "types;" the only difference is how far an underground segment of that material can reach. Use different pipes for aesthetic reasons, or underground length.
