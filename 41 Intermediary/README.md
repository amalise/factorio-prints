# Intermediates

This book contains production arrays for common use intermediate components. As each different collection of mods will potentially have different intermediate components with different recipes (Bob's, Angels, Krastorio2), there are not yet a lot of good, set-in-stone blueprints here.

## Sub-Books

### Vanilla

Blueprints for making each circuit type from Nilaus' Master Class video series on YouTube.
