# Science

This book contains blueprints for producing science packs in an even ratio. There are two blueprint sets, one from Nilaus' Master Class which produces 90 SPM, and one which uses all of Bob's production changes and science overhaul. There are also some different ideas for how to distribute science to labs, and a blueprint for a basic module science production chain which will eventually produce all of the Bob's Module researches.
