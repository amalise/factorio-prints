# Jumpstart

This book contains blueprints for creating an initial base, sometimes called a jumpstart base. This is NOT a base capable of launching a rocket, but rather a simple blueprint or set of blueprints to automate initial resource production and the first tier of most basic machines. Basically, through the first two sciences.

## Sub-Books

### Vanilla

Contains 2 different jumpstart bases. Nilaus' base is upgradable through three tiers, so the initial jumpstart can be started very early. Kathrine of Sky's is a single blueprint.

### Bob's - No Ore

A jumpstart base in several stages, because the hand-crafting phase of Bob's production chains can be quite complicated. This blueprint set includes several small hand-fed production clusters, then moves on to small belt-fed production areas similar to the Nilaus hub.

### Pre-Loader Storage

A collection of utility blueprints for creating early game buffer and recycling of components without loader.

## Upgrade Planners

None.

## Mod Support

* Bob's (optional, without Bob's Ore)
