# Ore

This blueprint book contains blueprints for all production arrays for all minable resources and their initial processing. It includes basic early-game versions as well as upgraded production arrays through late-game module use. The mining arrays snap to a small grid for easy coverage of a field.

## Sub-Books

* Basic Mining (no fluid needed)
* Fluid Mining (with fluid)
* Mine Storage Header (blueprint, feeds belts into a chest)

* Fuel Furnaces (2x2 furnaces which take fuel)
* Early Electric Furnaces (3x3 furnaces which take electricity)
* Moduled Arrays (3x3 furnaces with beacons)
* Bob's Insanity (A few beacons of what exactly is possible with Bob's Modules)

## Upgrade Planners

Upgrade planners are designed to convert all items of a type to the target type. So the Stone Furnace upgrade planner will convert all 2x2 furnaces to Stone.

Chemical and Ore Mixing Furnaces cause problems with upgrade and downgrade planners.

* Electric Miners (normal area coverage)
* Large Electric Miners (expanded area coverage)
* 2x2 Furnaces (fuel)
* 3x3 Furnaces (electric)
